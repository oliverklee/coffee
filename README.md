This is the example project used for demonstrating test-driven development (TDD)
with PHPUnit for TYPO3 CMS in Oliver Klee's workshops.


## Installing the extension

### For a TYPO3 installation in Composer mode

Add the following repository and require to the `composer.json` of your
TYPO3 installation:

```json
"require": {
    "oliverklee/coffee": "@dev"
}
```

### For a TYPO3 installation in classic (non-Composer) mode

Download the extensions as a ZIP from GitHub and upload it in the extension
manager.
